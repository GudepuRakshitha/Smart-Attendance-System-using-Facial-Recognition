# Smart Attendance System using Facial Recognition  
_Automated, Contactless Attendance Management with Real-Time Face Detection_

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Attendance System** is an AI-powered solution that uses **facial recognition** for automated attendance tracking. Built using **OpenCV** and **Flask**, the system captures, verifies, and logs facial data, offering a secure and efficient way to manage attendance in classrooms, offices, or events.

## 🧠 How It Works
Dataset Collection:
User images are captured and stored in the /dataset/ folder for each individual.

Model Training:
The system trains a facial recognition model (e.g., LBPH) from the dataset.

Real-Time Detection:
Live video feed captures faces and compares them against the trained model.

Logging:
Verified users’ attendance is recorded in attendance.csv with a timestamp.
